        * I know when to use different data types (integers, floating point, Boolean, strings, et cetera) and data structures and can explain why it is important to use the correct data type or structure.

 # Question 4
 
 You are creating an app to help people be aware of how much time they spend on their phone.
 
 For a given day, this information will be tracked:
 
 * Apps: the number of different apps used today on your phone
 * Hours: the total number of hours (including part of an hour) that the screen was on
 * Most popular app: the name of the app that you used the most on a given day
 * Date: the current date (e.g.: Thursday, January 18, 2018)
 
 **Choose the appropriate data type for each piece of information**.
 
 **Then, use `print()` statements to explain why you chose a particular data type for a given piece of information.**

// Answer question 4 below

let numberApps : Int
print("The total number of apps are whole numbers since their a re no half apps, therefore it is an integer.")
let totalHours : Double
print("Hours, may have parts because of the minutes and seconds, therefore it is a double since it has decimals." )
let mostPopularApp : String
print("Most popular app name has a text value thats why it is a string.")
let date : String
print("Date includes text therefore it is a string.")
